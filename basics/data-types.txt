1. Create a Java program that declares variables of different data types (e.g., int, double, float, long, short).
   Perform explicit casting to convert variables of one data type to another.
   Print the values of variables before and after casting to observe the differences.

2. Create a Java program to calculate Simple Interest.
  Declare variables to store principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.
  Calculate the Simple Interest using the formula: Simple Interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100.
  Print the calculated Simple Interest value.
