1. Create a Parent Class "Vehicle" with attributes (name, numberOdWheels, numberOfGear, numberOfSeats, speedLimit etc) and behaviors/methods (moves, honk etc)
	->use concept of access specifier(public,private and protected) for each attributes
	->use getter and setter to access private attributes
2. Create Children classes Car, Bike, Truck from Vehicle Parent class
	->Override the attributes and behaviors
3. Create a Parent class Man and two children classes Sameer and Ramesh with required attributes and behaviors.
	-> Use concept of Runtime polymorphism to hold Child class objects(Sameer and Ramesh) into Parent(Man) class.
4. Write a class Multiplication having three overloaded methods:
	-> multiplyNumbers(a,b)
	-> multiplyNumbers(a,b,c)
	-> multiplyNumbers(a,b,c,d)

   What is polymorphism
   Difference between compile-time and run-time polymorphism
